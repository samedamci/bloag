# bloag

Database-less RSS and static HTML blog generator from Markdown files.
Created to deploying blog on [samedamci.me](https://samedamci.me/blog).
Very basic and primitive version currently only working with this site.
In future I will create scheme to generate full blog from scratch but... not now.

## Usage
*Works only with samedamci.me blog...*

```
$ bloag -H blog/index.html -R blog/rss.xml -M input.md
```
